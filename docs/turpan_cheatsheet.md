# Turpan Cheatsheet

Please read this cheatsheet since it contains some updated instructions compared to last Turpan training. Especially, the reservation argument for slurm and some envs arguments for Apptainer that allow to work with HuggingFace.

## Logging in the cluster

For convenience, create a config file in `~/.ssh/config` with the following content:

```
Host turpan
    Hostname turpanlogin.calmip.univ-toulouse.fr
    User YOUR_USERNAME
    PreferredAuthentications password
    PubkeyAuthentication no
```

Then you can simply log in with:

```bash
ssh turpan
```

## Updating the repository

To update your forked repo with the latest changes from this original repo, run:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Work remotely from vscode

I strongly encourage you to use vscode remote environment to work on the project. On the leftbar of vscode, you should see an icon "Remote Explorer". Click on it, then click on "SSH" if needed, and click the left arrow next to "turpan". You will have to fill your password. Once you are connected, you can open the project folder and work on it as if it was local. You can even run the code in a terminal in vscode.

## `uv` environment and AppTainer

First, create an env directory in `/tmpdir`:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmpdir/YOUR_USERNAME/envs
mkdir -p /tmpdir/YOUR_USERNAME/uv-cache
```

Save the following command as an alias in your `~/.bashrc` to avoid having to write it every time. Add these lines (DO NOT FORGET TO REPLACE `YOUR_USERNAME`):

```bash
alias run_apptainer_login="apptainer shell \
--env PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH \
--env UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmpdir/YOUR_USERNAME/envs/aai \
--env UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmpdir/YOUR_USERNAME/uv-cache \
--env HF_HOME=/work/formation/YOUR_USERNAME/huggingface \
--bind /tmpdir,/work \
--nv /work/conteneurs/sessions-interactives/pytorch-24.02-py3-calmip-si.sif"
```
and then refresh the `~/.bashrc` with `source ~/.bashrc`. Then run 
```bash
run_apptainer_login
```
to launch the apptainer image on a login node.

You are now in the `apptainer` image! Install the env using:

```bash
uv venv --system-site-packages /tmpdir/YOUR_USERNAME/envs/aai
uv sync --only-group turpan
``` 
Now the environment should be up and running.

## Running the code on the compute nodes

To run some code on the compute nodes, you have two choices. You can either use the node in interactive mode, meaning that you have a shell on the compute node where you can run commands one by one, or you can submit a job, meaning that you write a script with the commands you want to run and submit it to the cluster, which will run it for you.

### Interactive mode

First, add this alias in your `~/.bashrc` to avoid having to write it every time. Add these lines (DO NOT FORGET TO REPLACE `YOUR_USERNAME`):

```bash
alias run_apptainer_gpu="srun -p shared -n1 --gres=gpu:1 --pty apptainer shell \
--env PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH \
--env UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmpdir/YOUR_USERNAME/envs/aai \
--env UV_NO_SYNC=true \
--env HF_HOME=/work/formation/YOUR_USERNAME/huggingface \
--env HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 \
--env HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1 \
--env TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 \
--bind /tmpdir,/work \
--nv /work/conteneurs/sessions-interactives/pytorch-24.02-py3-calmip-si.sif"
```
and then refresh the `~/.bashrc` with `source ~/.bashrc`. Then run 

```bash
run_apptainer_gpu
```

to launch the apptainer image on a compute node.

You can check that you are on a compute node by using `nvidia-smi`. Then you can run your scripts as you would do in a local machine.

### Batch mode

For long scripts, often running overnight, you do not want to keep your terminal open. Instead, you will set up an instruction script (**a job**) giving the cluster all the information it needs to run your code. This script is an `.sbatch` script and looks like this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J mon_job
#SBATCH --nodes 1
#SBATCH --ntasks 1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH -p shared
#SBATCH --time=00:15:00 
#SBATCH --reservation=tpirt5 # CHANGE THIS ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE
#SBATCH --output=/users/formation/YOUR_USERNAME/job_results/out/job_%j.out
#SBATCH --error=/users/formation/YOUR_USERNAME/job_results/err/job_%j.err


apptainer exec \
--env PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH \
--env UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmpdir/YOUR_USERNAME/envs/aai \
--env UV_NO_SYNC=true \
--env HF_HOME=/work/formation/YOUR_USERNAME/huggingface \
--env HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 \
--env HF_DATASETS_OFFLINE=1 \
--env TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 \
--bind /tmpdir,/work \
--nv /work/conteneurs/sessions-interactives/pytorch-24.02-py3-calmip-si.sif \
uv run python mon_script.py
```

Take the time to understand each `#SBATCH` line of the script:

- `--nodes 1`: Number of nodes to use (1 in our case)
- `--ntasks 1`: Number of tasks to run (1 in our case, it is the number of times the command will be run.
- `--cpus-per-task=8`: Number of CPU cores to allocate for this job (8 in our case, change it according to your needs)
- `--gres=gpu:1`: Number of GPU to use (1 in our case)
- `-p shared`: Partition to use (shared in our case, do not change this, it tells the cluster not to use the full node)
- `--time=00:15:00`: Time limit for the job (15 minutes in this case, change it according to your needs)
- `--reservation=tpirt4`: Reservation to use (tpirt4 in this case, change it according to the schedule of the PP sessions - see below)
- `--output`: Path to the file where the standard output of the job will be saved (change YOUR_USERNAME and the path according to your needs)
- `--error`: Path to the file where the standard error of the job will be saved (change YOUR_USERNAME and the path according to your needs)

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `mon_script.py` with your username and the script you want to run.**

Let's call this file `run_job.sbatch`. You can submit this job to the cluster with:

```bash
# CHANGE THE RESERVATION ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE
sbatch --reservation=TP_RESERVATION_NAME run_job.sbatch
```

and check the status of your job with:

```bash
jobinfo job_id
```
where `job_id` is the id of your job given by the output of the `sbatch` command. You can also check the id using:

```bash
squeue -u $USER -l
```

which displays informations about running jobs.


!!! Note
    The `--reservation=TP_RESERVATION_NAME` option is specific to this cluster and allows you to use the reserved resources for the Programming Practical sessions. Replace `TP_RESERVATION_NAME` with the appropriate reservation name for each PP following this schedule:


| Date | Reservation name |
|------|------------------|
| 09-03-2026 | tpirt1 |
| 13-03-2026 | tpirt2 |
| 20-03-2026 | tpirt4 |
| 03-04-2026 | tpirt5 |
| 27-05-2026 | tpirt6 |
| 29-05-2026 | tpirt7 |
| 01-06-2026 | tpirt8 |
| 03-06-2026 | tpirt9 |
| 05-06-2026 | tpirt10 |
| 08-06-2026 | tpirt11 |
| 10-06-2026 | tpirt12 |
| 12-06-2026 | tpirt13 |
| 19-06-2026 | tpirt14 |
| 22-06-2026 | tpirt15 |
| 23-06-2026 | tpirt16 |
| 24-06-2026 | tpirt17 |
| 26-06-2026 | tpirt18 |

The code will run silently on the cluster but it will output `stdin` and `stderr` in `--output` and `--error` paths specified in the `.sbatch` script. First, create the paths:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/job_results/out
mkdir -p ~/job_results/err
```

Then you can check the output and error of your job with (Replace job_id with your job_id):

```bash
cat ~/job_results/out/job_job_id.out
cat ~/job_results/err/job_job_id.err
```

Or open it in vscode and refresh it when you want to check the output / error. One super convenient way to check the output on vscode is to click File > Add folder to workspace, then add the `job_results` folder. Then you can open the `out` and `err` folders in the vscode explorer alongside your code and open the output and error files of your job.
